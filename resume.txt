PROFILE
I am an AI/ML Engineer with hands-on experience building end-to-end AI products, real-time backend systems, and automation tools. I work mostly with Python, FastAPI, OpenAI, vector databases, MongoDB, and data/BI tools like Power BI. I’ve built production-grade systems for recruitment automation, audit workflows, timesheet management, chatbots, and document automation. I care about solving real business problems with AI, keeping things practical, and owning the solution from idea to deployment and analysis.

PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE
--------------------------------------------------

AI/ML Engineer – JHS Associates & LLP
May 2024 – Present | Mumbai, India

1) AI-Powered Recruitment System (End-to-End)
- Designed and built an AI-driven recruitment platform where HRs upload resumes that get converted to embeddings and stored in Pinecone.
- HR specifies role, score/threshold, and a natural-language description; the system ranks and matches candidates using OpenAI + Pinecone.
- Filtered candidates are sent to OpenAI for further screening based on the role description.
- Integrated WhatsApp via Infobip BSP to automatically message matched candidates that they’ve been shortlisted.
- Built a webhook flow to converse with candidates, collect responses, and schedule interviews; all candidate states are stored in MongoDB.
- HR dashboard shows: messaged candidates, scheduled interviews, selected/rejected/joined status, and candidate funnel analytics.
- Added manual filters on role, location, qualification, and experience so HRs can refine results themselves.

Tech stack: Python, FastAPI, OpenAI, Pinecone, MongoDB, Infobip, HTML/CSS/JS.

2) Timesheet Application (Internal)
- Built a timesheet system where employees record daily tasks and hours; data is stored in the database.
- Reporting Managers can approve or reject timesheets for their team.
- Created an admin view for the accounts/management team showing: who filled timesheets, total hours worked, projects worked on, and approval status.
- Designed Power BI dashboards to analyze utilization, project-wise hours, and compliance.
- Future work: integrating a chatbot so employees can describe their day in natural language and have the system auto-fill the timesheet.

3) StockEye – Auditor Workflow System
- Developed a tool for auditors to log their daily audit tasks along with a selfie and automatic location tagging.
- Built features to generate and send checklist reports to reporting managers.
- Implemented reconciliation logic between manager-provided data and auditor-submitted data.
- Delivered this product to a client and now extending it with an admin panel for control, configuration, and checklist analytics.

4) Power BI Dashboards and Analytics
- Built multiple Power BI dashboards for:
  - Timesheet analytics.
  - IT department metrics.
  - HR metrics.
  - Accounts and finance-related reporting.
- Combined these into an integrated view, giving leadership a single source of truth on people, projects, and work hours.

5) Workflow Automation and Reconciliation
- Automated repetitive workflows for clients: extracting data from PDFs and raw Excel files, cleaning them, performing matching and reconciliation, and generating ready-to-use outputs for the accounts and audit teams.
- Focused on reliability and reducing manual effort for recurring tasks.

6) Chatbot Development (Internal Knowledge Bots)
- Built chatbots using RAG + LangChain that answer questions based on:
  - HR policies.
  - Audit manuals.
  - Other internal documents.
- The bots use embeddings, vector search, and domain-specific prompts to respond strictly based on company data.

7) Email Automation Tool (Streamlit)
- Created a Streamlit-based tool that automates sending emails to all clients for festivals or important occasions.
- Designed the flow so my founder can quickly choose the template and client list and trigger bulk personalized emails without manual effort.

8) Regulatory Intelligence System (RIS)
- Built a scheduled system that fetches news from sources like Economic Times, Times of India, etc., using SerpAPI.
- Every day between 7 AM and 10 AM, it collects news based on keywords provided by my founder, extracts key details, and emails a curated summary to him at 10 AM.
- Scheduled and automated this via GitHub (cron/scheduled runs).

Upcoming / In-Progress Work at JHS
- “JHS ChatGPT”: an internal assistant that will answer questions based on company data (clients, work, processes). Data will be stored as embeddings in a vector database and queried via RAG.
- Company chatbots: audit manual chatbot, HR manual chatbot, and website chatbot answering based on internal content.
- Further automation and reconciliation pipelines for clients.
- Internal refinement of applications like HR help desk and IT help desk.

PERSONAL STORY & REFLECTIONS (FOR BEHAVIORAL QUESTIONS)
--------------------------------------------------

Life story in a few sentences
I come from an IT background and got hooked on how systems and data work behind the scenes. Over time I moved from just “coding” to building full products that solve real problems—like recruitment, audits, and automation for teams that actually use my tools daily. I enjoy combining AI, backend engineering, and data to build things that are useful, not just theoretical.

My #1 superpower
My superpower is end-to-end ownership. I’m comfortable taking a problem from an idea to a working product: understanding requirements, designing the architecture, building the backend and AI pipeline, wiring up dashboards or a simple frontend, and then iterating based on feedback.

Top 3 areas I want to grow in
1) Advanced machine learning and deep learning concepts, including more complex architectures and MLOps.
2) Communication and storytelling with data and product outcomes, especially for non-technical stakeholders.
3) Leadership and mentoring, so I can drive projects and help others grow instead of just solving everything myself.

Common misconception about me
People sometimes think I’m quiet or reserved, especially early in a project. In reality, I like to observe first, understand the context, and then contribute. Once I’m comfortable and clear on the problem, I’m very active with ideas, debugging, and collaboration.

How I push my boundaries and limits
I deliberately take on work that’s slightly ahead of my current comfort zone—like building a full recruitment system instead of just a model, or automating workflows end to end instead of writing one script. I break the work down, learn what I need, ask for help when needed, and treat each project as a chance to upgrade my skills and thinking.
